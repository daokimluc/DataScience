### R
[What is R?](https://www.r-project.org/about.html)
The R programming language is an free, open source, powerful and highly extensiblean source scripting language for predictive analytics and data visualization. It is very easy to build statistical models and plot graphics in R by point-and-click interface. So people with low level of programming can apply R driectly to their projects without spending much time to learn.
<\br> I often use Python for my research projects, but I recommend R as a fisrt choise to begin DataScience path. 

### Python
[What is Python?](https://www.python.org/)
I fall in love with Python when I used this language first time. Python is a powerfull programming language, an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Not only for data science, Python can be used in every fields today such as applications, security, web, etc. 
Python includes many incredible packages that I can not imagine. If you love beautiful graphics, seaborn is one of them.
Most applications today provide API for extracting data by Python. It means that if you know python, you have data.
If you want to use Python, I recommend you install [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/python). Anaconda includes all packages,libraries for your Datascience path. 

### Remain Languages
If you want to learn bigdata framework, you should read about Hadoop and study Spark. Why do I say "read" and "study"?
"Hadoop is an open-source software framework for storing data and running applications on clusters of commodity hardware. It provides massive storage for any kind of data, enormous processing power and the ability to handle virtually limitless concurrent tasks or jobs". Hadoop is quite old platforms, something that we can learn from Hadoop is "Map Reduce" idea. But you will explore "Map Reduce"
