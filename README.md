### R
[What is R?](https://www.r-project.org/about.html)
The R programming language is an free, open source, powerful and highly extensiblean source scripting language for predictive analytics and data visualization. It is very easy to build statistical models and plot graphics in R by point-and-click interface. So people with low level of programming can apply R driectly to their projects without spending much time to learn.

I often use Python for my research projects, but I recommend R as a fisrt choise to begin DataScience path. 

### Python
[What is Python?](https://www.python.org/)
I fall in love with Python when I used this language first time. Python is a powerfull programming language, an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Not only for data science, Python can be used in every fields today such as applications, security, web, etc. 

Python includes many incredible packages that I can not imagine. If you love beautiful graphics, seaborn is one of them.

Most applications today provide API for extracting data by Python. It means that if you know python, you have data.

If you want to use Python, I recommend you install [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/python). Anaconda includes all packages,libraries for your Datascience path. 

### Remain Languages
If you want to learn bigdata frameworks, you should read about Hadoop and study Spark. Why do I say "read" and "study"?
"Hadoop is an open-source software framework for storing data and running applications on clusters of commodity hardware. It provides massive storage for any kind of data, enormous processing power and the ability to handle virtually limitless concurrent tasks or jobs". Hadoop is quite old platforms, something that we can learn from Hadoop is "Map Reduce" idea. But you will explore "Map Reduce" capacity when you study Spark. 

Spark is powerful framework for realtime processing. I finished some [Spark courses](https://www.edx.org/course/big-data-analysis-apache-spark-uc-berkeleyx-cs110x) because learning Spark you also learn Scala, Python, Java and Machine Learning. You can reference my repo for study Spark.

I like the recommendation of William Chen.
Before you begin, you need Multivariable Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Python. If your math background is up to multivariable calculus and linear algebra, you'll have enough background to understand almost all of the probability / statistics / machine learning for the job.

Multivariate Calculus: What are the best resources for mastering multivariable calculus?
Numerical Linear Algebra / Computational Linear Algebra / Matrix Algebra: Linear Algebra, Introduction to Linear Models and Matrix Algebra. Avoid linear algebra classes that are too theoretical, you need a linear algebra class that works with real matrices.

Multivariate calculus is useful for some parts of machine learning and a lot of probability. Linear / Matrix algebra is absolutely necessary for a lot of concepts in machine learning.
## Courses
[CS109 of Harvard](http://cs109.github.io/2015/)
This course will provide methods for five key facets of an investigation: data wrangling, cleaning, and sampling to get a suitable data set; data management to be able to access big data quickly and reliably; exploratory data analysis to generate hypotheses and intuition; prediction based on statistical methods such as regression and classification; and communication of results through visualization, stories, and interpretable summaries.

I think this is a standard course for undergraduate student for Data Science. The design of this course is very clear, step by step. 

Please check out [Class material](http://cs109.github.io/2015/pages/videos.html). But you should use labs and lectures from 2015 and the homeworks from 2013.

[Stat 110 of Harvard](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110/home)
From my opinion, this is the most wonderful probability course in the world.Very atttractive, very useful, very clear, etc. I studied this course before CS109.

This course will provide Basics: sample spaces and events, conditioning, Bayes' Theorem. Random variables and their distributions: distributions, moment generating functions, expectation, variance, covariance, correlation, conditional expectation. Univariate distributions: Normal, t, Binomial, Negative Binomial, Poisson, Beta, Gamma. Multivariate distributions: joint, conditional, and marginal distributions, independence, transformations, Multinomial, Multivariate Normal. Limit theorems: law of large numbers, central limit theorem. Markov chains: transition probabilities, stationary distributions, reversibility, convergence. The prerequisites are calculus (mainly single variable) and familiarity with matrices.

One more thing is the book the we use this course. This is incredible book of probability. If you are patient to solve all problems in the book, you will understand all magic things in probability, and it will help you so much not only in Data Science, even in Finance. 

Here is the book, [Introduction to Probability](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1466575573/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1466575573&linkCode=as2)

[Stat Learning of Stanford](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/HumanitiesSciences/StatLearning/Winter2016/about)
This course if free for all people. If you finish this course, you will get certification. The main language in this course is R. It should be noted that it is not heavy math-class. 

This course is an introductory-level course in supervised learning, with a focus on regression and classification methods. The syllabus includes: linear and polynomial regression, logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis; cross-validation and the bootstrap, model selection and regularization methods (ridge and lasso); nonlinear models, splines and generalized additive models; tree-based methods, random forests and boosting; support-vector machines. Some unsupervised learning methods are discussed: principal components and clustering (k-means and hierarchical).

You can also learn other courses in online program self-learning of Stanford such as algorithm, convex optimization, mining massive data, etc.


## Practice
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) is the first website that you should take. Kaggle is a great way to start for those who prefer learning by doing (rather than learning by reading books or watching lectures).

You can clone data, code and awesome R or Ipython notebooks from other guys. Kagllge is a place that people share the experience, code style and ideas. You can also build your team to participate some competitions with very high prize.

Here is some notebooks you should look if you want to begin with Kaggle:
[Comprehensive data exploration with Python](https://www.kaggle.com/pmarcelino/comprehensive-data-exploration-with-python)
[Full Preprocessing Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/gzuidhof/full-preprocessing-tutorial)

[Data](https://datahub.io/search) is the datahub that provide many datasets for you to explore and study. It includes many fields from education, traffic, house prize, government, etc.
